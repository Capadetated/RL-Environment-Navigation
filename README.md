# RL-Environment-Navigation

A Tabular Q-Learning Reinforcement Learning Project of an agent learning to navigate a simulated environment.

This was a Python-based project using Tabular Q-learning in order to teach an agent to navigate a simulated environment of a guitar manufacturing facility. The code was adjusted 6 times in order to show critical features and their effects (like finding optimal routes, training iteration number, alpha (learning rate), gamma (discount factor), and changing the environment).

"Environment Navigation RL Fitch.pdf" contains the text of the analysis along with the supporting figures and tables. "Environment Navigation Tabular Q-Learning.py" contains the code used to answer question 9 from the text. All other adjustments can be easily made using this code.
